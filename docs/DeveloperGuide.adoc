By: `W09-GroupB1`      Since: `FEB 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. Ensure that you have *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later installed in your computer.
+
====
[NOTE]
If you do not already have *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later installed, click http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here] to do so.
[WARNING]
CarviciM works only with this version of Java 8 or later, and not on earlier versions. +
Please http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[update your JDK] if your current version is earlier than the stated.
====
+
. You will need to use *IntelliJ* IDE for this project.
+
====
[NOTE]
If you do not have *IntelliJ* IDE installed, click https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[here] to do so.
[WARNING]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.
====

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). You should see the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate for you all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.carvicim.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

The code for CarviciM follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

****
*Optional*

You can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.
****

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

****
*Optional*

. After setting up Travis, you can set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).
+
[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.
+
. You can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).
+
[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)
+
****

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
[none]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* (figure 1) given above explains the high-level design of the App. Read this section (section 2) to get a quick overview of each component.

====
[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.
====

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch:
** Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down:
** Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.


<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its <<api, _API_>> in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's <<api, API>> in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below (figure 3) shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
[none]

====
[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.
====

The diagram below (figure 4) shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
[none]

====
[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.
====

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

<<api, *API*>> : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX[JavaFx] UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


<<api, *API*>> :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]


Here is what happens when the UI makes an `execute()` call to Logic:
.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a employee) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.


For a more specific example of the steps above, given below (figure 8) is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` <<api, API>> call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


<<api, *API*>> : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]


The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


<<api, *API*>> : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]


The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::addJob[]
=== Add job feature
==== Current Implementation

`Job` is part of the `Model` component which is made up of `Person`, `JobNumber, `VehicleNumber`, `Status`, `Date`, `UniqueEmployeeList` and `RemarkList` (refer to figure).

.Class Diagram of Model component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

`Person` represents the client of a job. `JobNumber` represents the number of a job and is responsible for generating a running number for each job. `Status` represents the status of a job which holds value of either `ongoing` or `closed` that is used for categorizing jobs. `Date` represents the date of creation for the job. `RemarkList` holds all `Remark` belonging to the job. `UniqueEmployeeList` of the job represents the employees assigned.

The job adding mechanism is facilitated by a `AddJobCommand` which is an `UndoableCommand`. `AddJobCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the input arguments. It utilizes `ParserUtil` for the validation of `NAME`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, `VEHICLE_NUMBER` and `ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE_INDEX` and creates `AddJobCommand` object which prepares the `Job` object.

====
[NOTE]
If the parameters are invalid, `addj` command will return an invalid message, which shows the usage information to the user.
(e.g. `addj n/John Doe p/9999999 e/john@example.com v/SHG123 w/-1`).
====

`AddJobCommandParser` code snippet to validate the parameters, `NAME`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, `VEHICLE_NUMBER`, `ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE_INDEX+`, which returns `AddJobCommand` object if valid, and invalid message otherwise:
[source,java]
----
    public AddJobCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =
                ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_PHONE,
                        PREFIX_EMAIL, PREFIX_VEHICLE_NUMBER, PREFIX_ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE);

        if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_PHONE,
                PREFIX_EMAIL, PREFIX_VEHICLE_NUMBER, PREFIX_ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE)) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddJobCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        try {
            Name name = ParserUtil.parseName(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME)).get();
            Phone phone = ParserUtil.parsePhone(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PHONE)).get();
            Email email = ParserUtil.parseEmail(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_EMAIL)).get();
            VehicleNumber vehicleNumber =
                    ParserUtil.parseVehicleNumber(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_VEHICLE_NUMBER)).get();
            ArrayList<Index> assignedEmployeeIndices =
                    ParserUtil.parseIndices(argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE));

            Person client = new Person(name, phone, email);
            return new AddJobCommand(client, vehicleNumber, assignedEmployeeIndices);

        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddJobCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }
----

`preprocessUndoableCommand` method code snippet in `AddJobCommand` that checks if assigned employee exists for the indices given. It creates `Job` object only if valid, and throws an invalid message otherwise:
[source,java]
----
    protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<Employee> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        //Check for valid employee indices
        for (Index targetIndex : targetIndices) {
            if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
                throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_EMPLOYEE_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
            }
        }

        try {
            for (Index targetIndex : targetIndices) {
                assignedEmployees.add(lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()));
            }
            toAdd = new Job(client, vehicleNumber, new JobNumber(), new Date(), assignedEmployees,
                    new Status(Status.STATUS_ONGOING), new RemarkList());
        } catch (DuplicateEmployeeException e) {
            throw new CommandException("Duplicate employee index");
        }

    }
----

The successful execution of `AddJobCommand` adds the `Job` to CarviciM.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Modelling jobs in CarviciM

* **Current choice:** Adding a list to keep track of all jobs in CarviciM, and adding an attribute for keeping a list of assigned employees in `Job` class.
** Pros: Finding assigned employees of a job, requires only going through the assigned employee list of the job. Removal of a job is done easily by removing it from the list of jobs.
** Cons: Additional list to maintain, other than the list of employees. Changes to an employee needs to be updated for all jobs that contains the respective employee.
* _Alternative:_ Add a new attribute in `Employee` class to keep a list of jobs.
** Pros: Only need to maintain a single list of employees. Finding jobs that are assigned to an `Employee` object only requires going through the job list.
** Cons: Finding all employees belonging to a job, requires going through the job list of all employees. The removal of a job, requires going through all employees, as a job can be assigned to multiple employees.

===== Aspect: Checking if given employee indices point to valid employees in CarviciM

* **Current choice:** Perform check in the `preprocessUndoableCommand` method of `AddJobCommand`.
** Pros: Does not introduce more coupling.
** Cons: `AddJobCommand` will need to store more attributes, as a `Job` object is only created when `preprocessUndoableCommand` method is executed successfully.
* _Alternative:_ Allow `ParserUtil` to hold employee list.
** Pros: `AddJobCommandParser` determines if the employee indices point to valid employees, and creates the `Job` object.
** Cons: Allowing `ParserUtil` to hold the list of employees introduce more coupling among the classes.
// end::addJob[]

// tag::set[]
=== Set command feature
==== Current Implementation

.ClassDiagram of CommandWords at runtime
image::SetCommandObjectDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

`SetCommand` keeps 2 lists of command words:
* the default command words
** stored as a class level reference `COMMANDS`
* the custom user command words
** stored as a field `commands` in the object
Both are managed by the class `CommandWords`.

`CommandWords` is in the `Logic` component, under `Commands`, as it is required to parse commands in `AddressBookParser`.

`CommandWords` only deal with commands that have their default command word declared in the class level reference.

As you can see from figure 12, AddressBookParser makes a reference to CommandWords. However, `CommandWords` resides in `UserPrefs` in the `Model` component. This is to facilitate the saving of data. CommandWords also has a method checkIntegrity, which ensures that object command words are 1 to 1 with class command words. This allows forward compatibility, as well as protects against data corruption to some extent.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where to put CommandWords for storage

* **Current choice:** Place `CommandWords` in `UserPrefs`
** Pros: Single Responsibility Principle is maintained as custom command words in `CommandWords` is a user preference.
** Cons: More coupling is required for the AddressBook to retrieve the custom command words.
* _Alternative:_ Place `CommandWords` in `AddressBook`
** Pros: Direct access to custom words in commands.
** Cons: Single Responsibility Principle will be violated.

===== Aspect: Access to CommandWords

* **Current choice:** Provide direct access to `CommandWords` when more details are needed and keep minimal <<api, API>> on `ModelManager`.
** Pros: Easy to implement, and is neat.
** Cons: Accidental modification can lead to bugs.
* _Alternative:_ `ModelManager` and member variables gets access and provides <<api, API>> to access `CommandWords`.
** Pros: Write protection.
** Cons: `CommandWords` is frequently accessed, so many more <<api, APIs>> are required.


===== Aspect: Storing the list of default command words

* **Current choice:** Store the default list in `CommandWords`.
** Pros: Easier to maintain the Open-Closed Principle, also follows the Single Responsibility Principle.
** Cons: Increased coupling.
* _Alternative:_ Store the default list in `Commands`.
** Pros: Reduced coupling.
** Cons: `Commands` is an abstract class, it is not appropriate to reference class variables.
// end::set[]

// tag::importexport[]
=== Import/Export feature #Coming in v2.0#
==== Current Implementation

image::blank.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations
// end::importexport[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Theme setting feature
==== Current Implementation

The theme setting mechanism is facilitated by a `ThemeCommand`. `ThemeCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the input arguments. It utilizes `ParserUtil` for the validation of `INDEX` input of `1` to `2`, and creates the `ThemeCommand` object which selects the application's theme.
The `UserPref` stores and retrieves the theme preference of the application.

`ThemeCommand` relies on `SetThemeRequestEvent` which is handled by `MainWindow` to call the appropriate method for setting of theme.

====
[NOTE]
If there is no `INDEX` present, `theme` command will return an invalid message, which shows the usage information to the user.
(e.g. theme "").
====
`ThemeCommand` code snippet to check for valid `INDEX` input and raises the `SetThemeRequestEvent` handler for setting of the desired theme, based on the `INDEX` input:
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        if (selectedIndex.getZeroBased() >= NUMBER_OF_THEMES) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_THEME_INDEX);
        }
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new SetThemeRequestEvent(selectedIndex));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_THEME_CHANGE_SUCCESS, selectedIndex.getOneBased()));
    }
----

`ThemeCommandParser` code snippet to validate `INDEX` input, which returns `ThemeCommand` object if valid, and invalid message otherwise:
[source,java]
----
    public ThemeCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        try {
            Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
            return new ThemeCommand(index);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(
                    String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, ThemeCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }
----

`MainWindow` code snippet that handles `SetThemeRequestEvent` to set the theme of the application:
[source,java]
----
    private void handleSetThemeRequestEvent(SetThemeRequestEvent event) throws CommandException {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        setTheme(event.getSelectedIndex());
    }
----

`setTheme` method code snippet in `MainWindow` that checks for file existence before removing current theme and applying the selected theme. Selected theme is then updated in the `UserPref`:
[source,java]
----
    private void setTheme(Index selectedIndex) throws CommandException {
        String themeName = themes[selectedIndex.getZeroBased()];
        if (MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + themeName + "Theme.css") == null) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_FILE_PATH);
        }

        getRoot().getScene().getStylesheets().clear();
        getRoot().getScene().getStylesheets().add(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + themeName + "Theme.css");
        getRoot().getScene().getStylesheets().add(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + "Extensions" + themeName + ".css");
        prefs.setExtensionName("Extensions" + themeName);
        prefs.setThemeName(themeName + "Theme");

    }
----

`setTheme` method code snippet in `MainApp` that initializes the application's last selected theme:
[source,java]
----
    private void setTheme(Stage primaryStage) {
        primaryStage.getScene().getStylesheets().clear();
        primaryStage.getScene().getStylesheets().add("/view/" + userPrefs.getThemeName() + ".css");
        primaryStage.getScene().getStylesheets().add("/view/" + userPrefs.getExtensionName() + ".css");
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ThemeCommand` +
* **Current choice:** Utilizing `SetThemRequestEvent` and allow `MainWindow` to handle the raised event to set the theme of the application.
** Pros: Lesser responsibility for `ThemeCommand`.
** Cons: Harder for new developer to understand the behavior of theme setting, as it utilizes event handling.
* _Alternative:_ Instantiate `ThemeCommand` in `MainWindow` that passes `Stage` as a parameter. Then, perform theme setting in `ThemeCommand`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Violates Law of Demeter as `ThemeCommand` has knowledge and access to `Stage`.
// end::theme[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Inheritance diagram for commands
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

As you can see from the diagram above, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The steps below show the changes to the state of the stack for the `undo` command:

1. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

2. The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th employee in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command), as shown in the figure below.

.Step 1: `delete 5` command pushed onto the `undoStack`
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

3. As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, as shown in the figure below, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new employee.

.Step 2: execute `add n/David ...`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

====
[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.
====


4. The user now decides that adding the employee was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

As shown in the diagram below, we will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.Step 3: `undo` action
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

====
[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.
====

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.`undo` sequence diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

The `redo` does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

====
[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.
====

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.`clear` pushed into `undoStack`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.`list` not added into `undoStack`

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Stack activity diagram summary
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Current choice:** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* _Alternative:_ Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Current choice:** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* _Alternative:_ Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the employee being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Current choice:** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* _Alternative:_ Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* Current choice:** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* _Alternative:_ Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.

=== Send Email to Employees about Job

==== Current Implementation

This feature is implemented using Gmail <<api, API>>.

The following dependencies are used:

* com.google.api-client:google-api-client:1.23.0
* com.google.oauth-client:google-oauth-client-jetty:1.23.0
* com.google.apis:google-api-services-gmail:v1-rev82-1.23.0

===== Authorization

Suppose that the user typed the first email command.

.Email authorization sequence diagram
image::EmailAuthorization.png[width="650"]

. `GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow` is used to build the authorization code flow and trigger user authorization request. It then manages and persists user `Credential`.

. `Credential` is then saved into a `File` so that the user need not repeatedly key in his or her authorization information before sending each email.

===== Sending an email

. An empty `Properties` list is created, which is used to create an email `Session`
. A `MimeMessage`, a class in the `javax.mail.internet` package is created using that `Session`.
. Attributes `from`, `recipient`, `subject` and `text` of the `MimeMessage` are set. The `Text` set contains information extracted from the particular `Job`.
. `MimeMessage` is encoded using base64url.
. A `Message` object is instantiated.
. The value of the `raw` property of the `Message` is set to the encoded `MimeMessage`.
. Make a call to `messages.send` to send the email.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Email content

* **Current choice:** Email content contains job information extracted from the particular Job object only
** Pros: Easier to implement, and the email will be sent out very quickly, immediately after typing one line of command, making it more convenient for the user
** Cons: User has no ability to change or add to the contents of the email if the user wishes to.
* _Alternative:_ User gets to edit or add to the email content
** Pros: Provides flexibility as the user is allowed to change and add details to the email content.
** Cons: Need to direct user to an editor, thus more difficult to implement. User would also have to go through more steps than necessary if the user does not wish to change or add details to the email content

===== Aspect: Authorization information

* **Current choice:** Stored in file system so subsequent executions will not prompt for authorization
** Pros: More convenient for user as the user only needs to key in his or her authorization information once
** Cons: Unsafe
* _Alternative:_ Prompt for authorization for every subsequent executions
** Pros: Safe
** Cons: Inconvenient for user as user needs to always key in authorization information before sending each email

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation


We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

====
[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.
====

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.

****
*Optional*

Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.
****

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

====
[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.
====

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

====
[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.
====

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

[[Testing-TypesOfTests]]
=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.carvicim.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.carvicim.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.carvicim.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.carvicim.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing.

Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +

a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

====
[NOTE]
If you are new to working on Java projects, here are some steps to get started:

. Start by adding small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to your project one component at a time. Here are some suggestions: <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.
** It is important to program incrementally, as to prepare yourself for the next step.
. Proceed to add your feature, touching multiple components. This is to familiarize yourself with the process of implementing an end-to-end feature across all components. You can read more under <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>>.
====

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

You can familiarize yourself with existing components through the proposed exercises below, 1 for each component (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work). The Car Servicing Manager is divided into 4 main components:

1. <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Logic,*`Logic`*>>
2. <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Model,*`Model`*>>
3. <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-UI,*`UI`*>>
4. <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Storage,*`Storage`*>>

For each section, the exercises are structured in the following sequence:

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Logic]]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During <<dog-fooding, dog-fooding>>, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement <<alias, aliases>> for the command words. Your job is to implement such <<alias, aliases>>.

====
[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.
====

. Begin by adding a shorthand equivalent <<alias, alias>> for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all employees in the list.

+
====
[NOTE]
=====
*Hints*

** Just like how we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for <<alias, aliases>> as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
=====

====
[TIP]
=====
*Proposed Solution*

** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and <<alias, alias>> can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new <<Testing-TypesOfTests, tests>> for each of the <<alias, aliases>> that you have added.
** Update the <<UserGuide#, User Guide>> to document the new <<alias, aliases>>.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Model]]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model <<api, API>> does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an <<api, API>> method, so that your teammate can use your <<api, API>> to implement his command.

====
[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.
====

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.

+
====
[NOTE]
=====
*Hints*

** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] <<api, API>> need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use <<slap, SLAP>> to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing <<api, API>> methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a employee, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
=====
====

+
====
[TIP]
=====
*Proposed Solution*

** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each employee, and remove the `tag` from each employee.
** Add a new <<api, API>> method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new <<Testing-TypesOfTests, tests>> for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
=====
====

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-UI]]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a <<beta-testing, beta testing>> session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last employee in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

====
[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.
====

. Use different colors for different tags inside employee cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.

** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the `*hash code*` of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the `*hash code*` algorithm changes.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Storage]]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup <<api, API>> for the address book storage.

====
[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a employee specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first employee to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first employee.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

. Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.
+
* Main:

1. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
2. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

* Tests:

1. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
2. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

. Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`
+
* Main:

1. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
2. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
3. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

* Tests:

1. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
2. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
3. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

. Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each employee later.
+
* Main:

1. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
2. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

* Tests:

1. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

. Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.
+
* Main:

1. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
2. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

* Tests:

1. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

. Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`].
+
* Main:

1. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`].
2. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the employee will be created without a remark).
3. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `carvicim.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

. Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.
+
* Main:

1. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

* Tests:

1. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

. Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`].
+
* Tests:

1. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the employee that it is currently building.
2. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

. Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.
+
* Main:

1. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

* Tests:

1. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

. Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.
+
* Main:

1. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a employee.

* Tests:

1. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
