== Introduction

Welcome on board the CarviciM project! This guide will provide you with all the information you need to start contributing to CarviciM.

== Setting up

Before you can get started, here are some things you will need to do.

=== Prerequisites

. Ensure that you have *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later installed in your computer.
+
====
[NOTE]
If you do not already have *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later installed, click http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[here] to do so.
[WARNING]
CarviciM works only with this version of Java 8 or later, and not on earlier versions. +
Please http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[update your JDK] if your current version is earlier than the stated.
====
+
. You will need to use *IntelliJ* IDE for this project.
+
====
[NOTE]
If you do not have *IntelliJ* IDE installed, click https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows[here] to do so.
[WARNING]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.
====

=== Setting up the project in your computer

Here are the steps you can take to set up the project:
. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). You should see the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate for you all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.carvicim.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

The code for CarviciM follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

****
*Optional*

You can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.
****

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, links in the documentation will still point to the `se-edu/carvicim` repo.

If you plan to develop this as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to the `se-edu/carvicim`) , you should replace the URL in the variable `repoURL` in `DeveloperGuide.adoc` and `UserGuide.adoc` with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

==== Editing JavaFX

To edit the JavaFX scenes, download the `.jar` snapshot from
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/damithc/scenebuilder/build/1.0.9/artifacts.
Run the `.jar` file to get started.

****
*Optional*

. After setting up Travis, you can set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).
+
[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.
+
. You can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).
+
[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)
+
****

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

The *_Architecture Diagram_* below (figure 1) explains the high-level design of the App. Read this section (section 2) to get a quick overview of each component.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
[none]

====
[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.
====

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch:
** Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down:
** Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup method where necessary.


<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its <<api, _API_>> in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines it's <<api, API>> in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class (figure 2).

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below (figure 3) shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `deletee 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
[none]

====
[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `CarvicimChangedEvent` when the Carvicim data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.
====

The diagram below (figure 4) shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `deletee 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
[none]

====
[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.
====

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

<<api, *API*>> : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `JobListPanel`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class (figure 5).

The `UI` component uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX[JavaFx] UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


.Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in <<fig-LogicClassDiagram>>
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


<<api, *API*>> :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]


Here is what happens when the UI makes an `execute()` call to Logic:
.  `Logic` uses the `CarvicimParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a employee) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui` (figure 6).


For a more specific example of the steps above, given below (figure 8) is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletee 1")` <<api, API>> call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletee 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


<<api, *API*>> : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]


The `Model` (figure 9),

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Carvicim data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]


<<api, *API*>> : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]


The `Storage` component (figure 10),

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Carvicim data in xml format and read it back.
* can save the ArchiveJob data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::addjob[]
=== Add job feature
==== Current Implementation

To implement the job management feature, new classes are added to the `Model` component. `Job` is part of the `Model` component which is made up of `Person`, `JobNumber`, `VehicleNumber`, `Status`, `Date`, `UniqueEmployeeList` and `RemarkList` as shown below.

.Class Diagram of Model component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

`Person` represents the client of a job. `JobNumber` represents the number of a job and is responsible for generating a running number for each job. `Status` represents the status of a job which holds value of either `ongoing` or `closed` that is used for categorizing jobs. `Date` represents the date of creation for the job. `RemarkList` holds all `Remark` belonging to the job. `UniqueEmployeeList` of the job represents the employees assigned.

New classes has also been added in the Storage component, `XmlAdaptedJob` and `XmlAdaptedRemark`, to support the saving of job entries into the data file.


The job adding mechanism is facilitated by a `AddJobCommand` which is an `UndoableCommand`. `AddJobCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the input arguments. It utilizes `ParserUtil` for the validation of `NAME`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, `VEHICLE_NUMBER` and `ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE_INDEX` and creates `AddJobCommand` object which prepares the `Job` object.

====
[NOTE]
If the parameters are invalid, `addj` command will return an invalid message, which shows the usage information to the user.
(e.g. `addj n/John Doe p/9999999 e/john@example.com v/SHG123 w/-1`).
====

`AddJobCommandParser` code snippet to validate the parameters, `NAME`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, `VEHICLE_NUMBER`, `ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE_INDEX+`, which returns `AddJobCommand` object if valid, and invalid message otherwise:
[source,java]
----
    public AddJobCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =
                ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_PHONE,
                        PREFIX_EMAIL, PREFIX_VEHICLE_NUMBER, PREFIX_ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE);

        if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_PHONE,
                PREFIX_EMAIL, PREFIX_VEHICLE_NUMBER, PREFIX_ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE)) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddJobCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }

        try {
            Name name = ParserUtil.parseName(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME)).get();
            Phone phone = ParserUtil.parsePhone(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PHONE)).get();
            Email email = ParserUtil.parseEmail(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_EMAIL)).get();
            VehicleNumber vehicleNumber =
                    ParserUtil.parseVehicleNumber(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_VEHICLE_NUMBER)).get();
            ArrayList<Index> assignedEmployeeIndices =
                    ParserUtil.parseIndices(argMultimap.getAllValues(PREFIX_ASSIGNED_EMPLOYEE));

            Person client = new Person(name, phone, email);
            return new AddJobCommand(client, vehicleNumber, assignedEmployeeIndices);

        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddJobCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }
----

`preprocessUndoableCommand` method code snippet in `AddJobCommand` that checks if assigned employee exists for the indices given. It creates `Job` object only if valid, and throws an invalid message otherwise:
[source,java]
----
    protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<Employee> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        //Check for valid employee indices
        for (Index targetIndex : targetIndices) {
            if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
                throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_EMPLOYEE_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
            }
        }

        try {
            for (Index targetIndex : targetIndices) {
                assignedEmployees.add(lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased()));
            }
            toAdd = new Job(client, vehicleNumber, new JobNumber(), new Date(), assignedEmployees,
                    new Status(Status.STATUS_ONGOING), new RemarkList());
        } catch (DuplicateEmployeeException e) {
            throw new CommandException("Duplicate employee index");
        }

    }
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the `AddJobCommand` determines if a `Job` object can be created and added into the list of jobs if it is valid:

image::AddJobCommand_preprocess_SeqDiag.png[width="1000"]

image::AddJobCommand_execute_SeqDiag.png[width="500"]

The successful execution of `AddJobCommand` adds the `Job` to CarviciM.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Modelling jobs in CarviciM

* **Current choice:** Adding a list in `Carvicim` class to keep track of all jobs, and adding an attribute for keeping a list of assigned employees in `Job` class.
** Pros: Finding assigned employees of a job, requires only going through the assigned employee list of the job. Removal of a job is done easily by removing it from the list of jobs.
** Cons: Additional list to maintain, other than the list of employees. Changes to an employee needs to be updated for all jobs that contains the respective employee.
* _Alternative:_ Add a new attribute in `Employee` class to keep a list of jobs.
** Pros: Only need to maintain a single list of employees. Finding jobs that are assigned to an `Employee` object only requires going through the job list.
** Cons: Finding all employees belonging to a job, requires going through the job list of all employees. The removal of a job, requires going through all employees, as a job can be assigned to multiple employees.

===== Aspect: Checking if given employee indices point to valid employees in CarviciM

* **Current choice:** Perform check in the `preprocessUndoableCommand` method of `AddJobCommand`.
** Pros: Does not introduce more coupling.
** Cons: `AddJobCommand` will need to store more attributes, as a `Job` object is only created when `preprocessUndoableCommand` method is executed successfully.
* _Alternative:_ Allow `ParserUtil` to hold employee list.
** Pros: `AddJobCommandParser` determines if the employee indices point to valid employees, and creates the `Job` object.
** Cons: Allowing `ParserUtil` to hold the list of employees introduce more coupling among the classes.

===== Aspect: Ensuring job number generation is consistent

* **Current choice:** Store the next job number as a user preference.
** Pros: Easy to implement and initialization of job number is faster.
** Cons: Deletion of the user preference file will cause the job number to reset.
* _Alternative:_ Going through all jobs at initialization and finding the largest job number.
** Pros: Does not need to depend on data stored in other files to initialize job number.
** Cons: May be very slow when the number of jobs in the application is large.
// end::addjob[]

// tag::closejob[]
=== Close job feature
==== Current Implementation
The close job mechanisim is facilitated by a `CloseJobCommand`. `CloseJobCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the input arguments. It utilizes `ParserUtil` for the validation of `JOB_NUMBER` input, and creates the `CloseJobCommand` object which closes the job. A job that has been closed will have its status changed from "ongoing" to "closed".

Since `CloseJobCommand` is an undoable command, it overrides the `preprocessUndoableCommand` method of `UndoableCommand`, to check if the specified job can be closed.

====
[NOTE]
If the provided `JOB_NUMBER` belongs to a closed job or does not match any job in the job list, `CloseJobCommand` will return an invalid message. `CloseJobCommand` creates a copy of the job if it is found, and sets the status of the duplicate job to be "closed". This is to support the undo feature.
====

`preprocessUndoableCommand` method code snippet in `CloseJobCommand`, which checks for the respective job for closing:
[source,java]
----
    protected void preprocessUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        List<Job> lastShownJobList = model.getFilteredJobList();
        Iterator<Job> jobIterator = lastShownJobList.iterator();

        while (jobIterator.hasNext()) {
            Job currJob = jobIterator.next();
            if (currJob.getJobNumber().equals(this.targetJobNumber)
                    && (currJob.getStatus().value).equals(Status.STATUS_ONGOING)) {
                target = currJob;
                updatedJob = createUpdatedJob(currJob);
                break;
            }
        }

        if (target == null) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_JOB_NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }
----

'createUpdatedJob` method code snippet in `CloseJobCommand`, which creates a copy of the respective job with the status set as "closed":
[source,java]
----
    public static Job createUpdatedJob(Job jobToEdit) {
        assert jobToEdit != null;

        return new Job(jobToEdit.getClient(), jobToEdit.getVehicleNumber(), jobToEdit.getJobNumber(),
                jobToEdit.getDate(), jobToEdit.getAssignedEmployees(),
                new Status(Status.STATUS_CLOSED), jobToEdit.getRemarkList());
    }
----

`executeUndoableCommand` method code snippet in `CloseJobCommand`, which updates the job list with the job copy created:
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        requireNonNull(target);
        requireNonNull(updatedJob);
        try {
            model.closeJob(target, updatedJob);
        } catch (JobNotFoundException jnfe) {
            throw new AssertionError("The target job cannot be missing");
        }

        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_CLOSE_JOB_SUCCESS, updatedJob));
    }
----

The following sequence diagram show how the `preprocessUndoableCommand` method in the `CloseJobCommand` works:

The following diagram shows how the `executeUndoableCommand` method in the `CloseJobCommand` works:

image::CloseJobCommand_execute_SeqDiag.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Where to hold the closed jobs

* **Current choice:** Closed jobs and ongoing jobs are stored in the same list
** Pros: No need to add and maintain additional list for closed jobs.
** Cons: Requires iterating through all jobs to search for a particular job. Requires the usage of `Predicates` to filter out "ongoing" and "closed" jobs for displaying to user.
* _Alternative:_ Add an additional list for closed jobs in the `ModelManager`
** Pros: Jobs are stored in dedicated lists of either "ongoing" or "closed", and searching for jobs of a specific status only requires calling one list.
** Cons: More attributes to manage, and may cause duplicate or missing jobs if it is not managed properly.
// end::closejob[]

// tag::remark[]
=== Job remark feature
==== Current Implementation

The remark feature is facilitated by `RemarkCommand` which is an `UndoableCommand`. `RemarkCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the input arguments. It utilizes `ParserUtil` for the validation of `JOB_NUMBER` and `REMARK` input, and creates the `RemarkCommand` object.

Similar to the `CloseJobCommand`, the `RemarkCommand` is also an undoable command which overrides the `preprocessUndoableCommand` method of `UndoableCommand`. It checks if the specified job can have a remark added.

====
[NOTE]
If the paramters are invalid, `remark` command will return an invalid message, which shows the usage information to the user.
====

`RemarkCommandParser` code snippet to validate the parameters, `JOB_NUMBER` and `REMARK`, which returns `RemarkCommand` object if valid, and invalid message otherwise:

        if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_JOB_NUMBER, PREFIX_REMARK)
                || !argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {

        }

        try {
            Remark remark = ParserUtil.parseRemark(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_REMARK)).get();
            JobNumber jobNumber = ParserUtil.parseJobNumber(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_JOB_NUMBER)).get();

            return new RemarkCommand(remark, jobNumber);

image::RemarkCommand_execute_SeqDiag.png[width="400"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Checking if given `JOB_NUMBER` input points to a valid job in CarviciM
* **Current choice:** Perform check in the `preprocessUndoableCommand` method in `RemarkCommand`, by going through the list of jobs.
** Pros: Does not introduce more coupling.
** Cons: May take some time if job list has many entries.

=== Supporting setting of command word alias feature
==== Current Implementation

.Class Diagram with CommandWords
image::SetCommandClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

The user can set a command word alias using the command `set`, specifying the old command
word and new command word. This is how `set` command handles user requests using `currentWord`
and `newWord` respectively.

[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
        requireNonNull(model);
        try {
            model.getCommandWords().setCommandWord(currentWord, newWord);
        } catch (CommandWordException e) {
            throw new CommandException(e.getMessage());
        }
        if (CommandWords.isDefaultCommandWord(currentWord)) {
            return new CommandResult(getMessageDefaultSuccess());
        } else if (CommandWords.isDefaultCommandWord(newWord)) {
            return new CommandResult(getMessageRemoveAliasSuccess());
        }
        return new CommandResult(getMessageAliasSuccess());
    }
----

The command splits into 3 cases:

. When `currentWord` is a command word and `newWord` is an alias, `newWord` will be set as alias
for command specified by `currentWord`
[source,java]
+
----
CommandWords.isDefaultCommandWord(currentWord)
----

. When `newWord` is a command word and `currentWord` is an alias, `currentWord` will be removed
and the alias for command specified by `newWord` will be reset
[source,java]
+
----
CommandWords.isDefaultCommandWord(newWord)
----
. If `currentWord` and `newWord` are both new alias, the old alias will be replaced by the new alias.

[NOTE]
=====
The command will fail if one of the following occurs

* `currentWord` and `newWord` is the same
* `newWord` overwrites another alias or command word

[source,java]
----
    private void isCommandWordsValid(String currentWord, String newWord) throws CommandWordException {
        if (currentWord.equals(newWord)) {
            throw new CommandWordException(getMessageNoChange());
        }
        if (isDefaultCommandWord(newWord)
                && !commands.get(newWord).equals(currentWord)) {
            throw new CommandWordException(getMessageOverwriteDefault(newWord));
        }
        if (commands.containsValue(newWord)) {
            throw new CommandWordException(getMessageUsed(newWord));
        }
    }
----

* `currentWord` is not an existing alias or command word. This is checked by iterating through commands.

=====

`set` command makes use of class `CommandWords` to manage the custom command words.
`SetCommand` keeps 2 lists of command words:

* The default command words stored as a class level reference `COMMANDS`
* The command word aliases are stored as a field `commands` in the object

Both are managed by the class `CommandWords`.

CarvicimParser makes a reference to `CommandWords` to facilitate retrieval of alias command words.
However, `CommandWords` resides in `Model` (Figure 12). This is to facilitate the saving of data.

CommandWords also has a method `checkIntegrity()`, which ensures that object command words are 1 to 1 with class command words.
This allows forward compatibility when new command words are introduced, and old ones removed,
and protects against data corruption to some extent.

.Class Diagram with CommandWords
image::SetCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

At runtime, CarvicimParser checks if the command word provided by the user matches any of the alias before proceeding
parsing a command, as shown in Figure 13.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Where to put CommandWords for storage

* **Current choice:** Place `CommandWords` in `UserPrefs`
** Pros: Single Responsibility Principle is maintained as custom command words in `CommandWords` is a user preference.
CommandWords is also Serializable, which makes it compatible with `JsonUserPrefsStorage`.
** Cons: `CommandWords` is now coupled with `UserPrefs`
* _Alternative:_ Place `CommandWords` into a separate Storage class
** Pros: Reduced coupling.
** Cons: More files will be created in the application directory, making it more cluttered and cumbersome to backup.

===== Aspect: Access to CommandWords

* **Current choice:** Create getters and setters and provide a copy of `CommandWords` when more detail is needed.
** Pros: Easy to enforce rules on the changing of the alias in `CommandWords`.
** Cons: Need to modify getters and setters to change the implementation of `CommandWords`.
* _Alternative:_ Create `CommandWords` like an augmented `HashMap`
** Pros: Minimal new <<api, APIs>> are required, and flexibility is given to classes accessing `CommandWords`.
** Cons: Difficult to enforce rules, breaking the rules of mapped words can lead to bugs.


===== Aspect: Storing the list of default command words

* **Current choice:** Store the default list in `CommandWords`.
** Pros: Easier to maintain the Open-Closed Principle, also follows the Single Responsibility Principle.
** Cons: Command words have to be explicitly declared under class reference to support alias
* _Alternative:_ Store the default list in `Command`.
** Pros: `Command` is the super class of all commands, a method to enforce declaration of the command word
can be done easily.
** Cons: `Command` is an abstract class, it is not appropriate to reference class variables.

=== Import feature
==== Current Implementation

.Class Diagram of `session` component
image::SessionComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

`ImportSession` resides in the `Session` component in the `Storage` component as shown above. The
`Session` component is responsible for processing excel files, as well as keeping the state of the excel
files during runtime, in the form of `SessionData`.

`ImportSession` uses a Singleton design pattern. It is responsible for initializing and closing the session.
`ImportSession` has 4 methods:

* `static getInstance()`: Used to retrieve the single instance of `ImportSession`.
* `setData(sessionData)`: Used to set `sessionData` for `ImportSession`.
* `initialize(fileName)`: Initializes `sessionData` with and excel file located at `fileName`.
* `closeSession()`: Writes the comments as a save file to same directory of import file,
 with a timestamp added to the back of the filename.

`ImportSession` is designed to be stateless on its own, with all data stored in `SessionData`. This helps to
support `UndoableCommand`.
The flow of using `ImportSession` is as follows:

===== Loading a file into `ImportSession`

* Figure 15 below shows the process of initializing ImportSession. On the `import` command,
`getInstance` is used to retrieve the `importSession` instance, before it calls
`initialize(fileName)`. A new `SheetParser` is created to populate `sessionData` with excel sheet data
as shown in Figure 11, which comes as:
1. `SheetWithHeaderField`: Augmented `Sheet` that provides API to indicate approval status and
write comments.
2. `JobEntry`: Augmented `Job` stores the sheet number and row number for writing into the excel file.
`JobEntry` also contains the `Job` data which will be imported upon approval.
+
.Sequence Diagram of `ImportSession` initialization
image::sessionInitializationSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Reviewing job entries

* Figure 16 below shows the process of reviewing job entries in an import session. On the `review`
command, `sessionData` updates the relevant `jobEntry` and retrieves the sheet and row number,
which is used to update `sheetWithHeaderFields`. Upon reviewing a job, CarviciM will add the job and
any employees not present in the application.
+
.Sequence Digram of `ImportSession` during the reviewing of a job
image::sessionReviewSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Saving feedback from an `ImportSession`

`SessionData` autosaves the comments to an excel file with the same file name and `-comments.xls` or `-comments.xlsx` appended,
in the same directory.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Supporting UndoableCommand

* **Current choice:** Save a copy of the previous instance of `sessionData` using `createCopy()` whenever an
`UndoableCommand` is executed, then load the previous instance on undo. Data in the copy will be written to
a `.temp` file, with a timestamp prepended to its name to make it unique. Most of the `.temp` files will be
wiped on application exit.
** Pros: `sessionData` stores data for `importSession`, making it appropriate to be used as data in `undo`
and `redo`. Modification is only limited to `UndoableCommand`. Code for `undo` can be reused for any commands that
affect `sessionData` in the future, respecting Open Closed Principle.
** Cons: IOException still has to be handled in `sessionData` on undo. `undo` and `redo` can fail now because of IOException and they have to be modified. `.temp` files
can also cause home folder to bloat in size during runtime after many commands are entered.

* _Alternative:_ `importSession` provides API to `undo` and `redo`.
** Pros: `ImportSession` can effectively handle `undo` and `redo` on its own without additional dependencies.
Open Closed Principle is respected, there is no need to modify `UndoableCommand`.
** Cons: Difficult to coordinate with `UndoRedoStack` as jobs and employees in `model` are also affected. IOExceptions
thrown also need to be handled, requiring `UndoableCommand` to be modified for handling of Exceptions.

===== Aspect: Supporting mass add method addJobsAndNewEmployees

* **Current choice:** Add the methods to `Model`
** Pros: Cohesion is maximized, these methods can also be reused by other classes.
** Cons: Open Closed Principle is violated and adding these methods may result in confusion on the
behavior of `Model`.

* _Alternative:_ Add the methods to an abstract `ReviewCommand` and inherit the methods for `AcceptAll`/`RejectAll` commands.
** Pros: The behavior of these methods can be tailored specifically to `AcceptAll`/`RejectAll` commands.
** Cons: Modifying the implementation of `Model` may affect the behavior of `ReviewCommand` without knowing, leading to
potential regressions.

===== Aspect: Reading of first row headers from excel files

* **Current choice:** Allow compulsory and optional fields, with variable number of columns and variable order.
** Pros: Flexible on format of imported excel files. Also allows future expansion of single column fields.
** Cons: User may not appreciate the flexibility if he or she can enforce the format of the excel files received.
Flexibility provided is not enough for unknown headers.

* _Alternative:_ Fix the format of the headers.
** Pros: Confusion can be reduced, importing errors can also be minimized.
** Cons: Users cannot further customize job entries on import with optional fields, optional field data will be lost.

===== Aspect: Reading of job entries from excel files

* **Current choice:** Find the first complete job entry. Subsequently, whenever the next job entry is read, if there
are empty fields, take those fields from the previous job entry. Missing fields will be added to remarks and comments.
Repeat until there are no job entries in the file.
** Pros: Allows excel sheet providers to save time on filling reused data between adjacent job entries.
** Cons: Unintentional blanks may result in job entries with wrong data being imported, requiring the user to look
through the remarks of the imported job entries.

* _Alternative:_ Only import complete job entries
** Pros: Incomplete job entries will not be errorneously imported into CarviciM.
** Cons: User will not be able to review incomplete job entries in the CarviciM as only complete jobs are imported.

===== Aspect: Uniqueness of job entries

* **Current choice:** Use `jobNumber` in the application on import. To prevent reimporting the same excel
file twice, a file with the same name and a `-comments.xls` or `-comments.xlsx` appended, and every subsequent import reads from this file if
** Pros: Job entry number is controlled by CarviciM and can stay unique. Job entries from excel files can
also stay unique if there are no duplicates within or across excel files.
** Cons: User might import the same file if the `-comments.xls` or `-comments.xlsx gets misplaced, and become confused.
The `jobNumber` associated with the same imported job might also change on every different import.

* _Alternative:_ Use a hash function to decide the `jobNumber` of a job. When there is a collision, add a suffix to make the `jobNumber` unique.
** Pros: `jobNumber` stays the same on import, independent of when it is imported.
** Cons: `JobNumber` has to be modified to support this implementation.

// tag::theme[]
=== Theme setting feature
==== Current Implementation

The theme setting mechanism is facilitated by a `ThemeCommand`. `ThemeCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the input arguments. It utilizes `ParserUtil` for the validation of `INDEX` input of `1` to `2`, and creates the `ThemeCommand` object which selects the application's theme.
The `UserPref` stores and retrieves the theme preference of the application.

`ThemeCommand` relies on `SetThemeRequestEvent` which is handled by `MainWindow` to call the appropriate method for setting of theme.

====
[NOTE]
If there is no `INDEX` present, `theme` command will return an invalid message, which shows the usage information to the user.
(e.g. theme "").
====
`ThemeCommand` code snippet to check for valid `INDEX` input and raises the `SetThemeRequestEvent` handler for setting of the desired theme, based on the `INDEX` input:
[source,java]
----
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
        if (selectedIndex.getZeroBased() >= NUMBER_OF_THEMES) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_THEME_INDEX);
        }
        EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new SetThemeRequestEvent(selectedIndex));
        return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_THEME_CHANGE_SUCCESS, selectedIndex.getOneBased()));
    }
----

`ThemeCommandParser` code snippet to validate `INDEX` input, which returns `ThemeCommand` object if valid, and invalid message otherwise:
[source,java]
----
    public ThemeCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        try {
            Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
            return new ThemeCommand(index);
        } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
            throw new ParseException(
                    String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, ThemeCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        }
    }
----

`MainWindow` code snippet that handles `SetThemeRequestEvent` to set the theme of the application:
[source,java]
----
    private void handleSetThemeRequestEvent(SetThemeRequestEvent event) throws CommandException {
        logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event));
        setTheme(event.getSelectedIndex());
    }
----

`setTheme` method code snippet in `MainWindow` that checks for file existence before removing current theme and applying the selected theme. Selected theme is then updated in the `UserPref`:
[source,java]
----
    private void setTheme(Index selectedIndex) throws CommandException {
        String themeName = themes[selectedIndex.getZeroBased()];
        if (MainApp.class.getResource(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + themeName + "Theme.css") == null) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_FILE_PATH);
        }

        getRoot().getScene().getStylesheets().clear();
        getRoot().getScene().getStylesheets().add(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + themeName + "Theme.css");
        getRoot().getScene().getStylesheets().add(FXML_FILE_FOLDER + "Extensions" + themeName + ".css");
        prefs.setExtensionName("Extensions" + themeName);
        prefs.setThemeName(themeName + "Theme");

    }
----

`setTheme` method code snippet in `MainApp` that initializes the application's last selected theme:
[source,java]
----
    private void setTheme(Stage primaryStage) {
        primaryStage.getScene().getStylesheets().clear();
        primaryStage.getScene().getStylesheets().add("/view/" + userPrefs.getThemeName() + ".css");
        primaryStage.getScene().getStylesheets().add("/view/" + userPrefs.getExtensionName() + ".css");
    }
----

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `ThemeCommand` +
* **Current choice:** Utilizing `SetThemRequestEvent` and allow `MainWindow` to handle the raised event to set the theme of the application.
** Pros: Lesser responsibility for `ThemeCommand`.
** Cons: Harder for new developer to understand the behavior of theme setting, as it utilizes event handling.
* _Alternative:_ Instantiate `ThemeCommand` in `MainWindow` that passes `Stage` as a parameter. Then, perform theme setting in `ThemeCommand`.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Violates Law of Demeter as `ThemeCommand` has knowledge and access to `Stage`.
// end::theme[]

// tag::findbytag[]
=== Find by tag feature

==== Current Implementation

When the user enters `findt` followed by some keywords, for each existing employee, the employee's tags will be concatenated to form a String, with a space in between each tag. The `stream` method of `List` class will then be used to check if any of the keywords entered by the user matches any word in the concatenated string. The code for this algorithm is shown below:
[source,java]
----
public boolean test(Employee employee) {
    Set<Tag> employeeTags = employee.getTags();
    String tagsConcatenated = "";
    for (Tag tag: employeeTags) {
        tagsConcatenated = tagsConcatenated + tag.getTagName() + " ";
    }
    final String allTagNames = tagsConcatenated;

    return keywords.stream()
            .anyMatch(keyword -> StringUtil.containsWordIgnoreCase(allTagNames, keyword));
}
----

This algorithm is then repeated for all existing employees to get the filtered list.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Number of keyword matches
* **Current choice:** Only at least 1 keyword match is needed for the employee to appear on the filtered list.
** Pros: Useful for users who wish to see employees who only have at least 1 keyword as their tag in the filtered list.
** Cons: May not be useful for users who wish to search for employees that have all the keywords as their tags.
* _Alternative:_ All keywords have to match for the employee to appear on the filtered list.
** Pros: Useful for users who wish to search for employees that have all the keywords as their tags.
** Cons: May not be useful for users who wish to see employees who only have at least 1 keyword as their tag in the filtered list.
// end::findbytag[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort feature
==== Current Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by a `Comparator`. It supports the comparison of employee’s name and arranges the employee list alphabetically.

The `Comparator` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
    public UniqueEmployeeList sortList() {
        employees.sortName(new Comparator<Employee>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Employee employee1, Employee employee2) {
                return employee1.getName().toString().compareToIgnoreCase(employee2.getName().toString());
            }
        });
        return employees;
    }
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

.`SortCommand` sequence diagram
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `SortCommand` executes +
* **Current choice:** Sorts the employee list after typing in the sort command.
** Pros: Easy to implement, Able to locate the newly added employee easily at the end of the Employee UI Panel.
** Cons: May be a hassle to type the sort command word whenever we want to sort the employee list.
* _Alternative:_ Sorts the employee list automatically after adding new employee.
** Pros: We do not need to type in the sort command word.
** Cons: We must look through the entire employee list to locate the newly added employee.
// end::sort[]

// tag::archive[]
=== Archive feature
==== Current Implementation

The `ArchiveCommand` is facilitated by a `AddJobCommandParser`, which is responsible for parsing the input starting `Date` and ending `Date`.

`ArchiveCommandParser` code snippet that parses the starting and ending `Date`:
[source,java]
----
public ArchiveCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =
            ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_START_DATE, PREFIX_END_DATE);

    if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_START_DATE, PREFIX_END_DATE)
            || !argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, ArchiveCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }

    try {
        Date startDate = ParserUtil.parseDate(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_START_DATE)).get();
        Date endDate = ParserUtil.parseDate(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_END_DATE)).get();

        DateRange dateRange = new DateRange(startDate, endDate);
        return new ArchiveCommand(dateRange);
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
    }
}
----

The `ArchiveCommand` is implemented this way to ensure that the specified starting date is earlier than the ending date:
[source,java]
----
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    if (toArchive.compareTo(toArchive.getStartDate(), toArchive.getEndDate()) > 0) {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_INVALID_DATERANGE);
    }
    requireNonNull(model);
    archiveCount = model.archiveJob(toArchive);
    if (archiveCount != 0) {
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    }
    return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_UNSUCCESS);
}
----

`Carvicim` code snippet that extracts the job entries within the selected date range:
[source,java]
----
public int archiveJob(DateRange dateRange) {
    int archiveJobCount = 0;
    archiveJobs = new JobList();
    Date startDate = dateRange.getStartDate();
    Date endDate = dateRange.getEndDate();
    Status closed = new Status("closed");
    Iterator<Job> iterator = jobs.iterator();
    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        Job job = iterator.next();
        Date date = job.getDate();
        date = new Date(date.toString());
        Status status = job.getStatus();
        boolean withinRange = (dateRange.compareTo(date, startDate) >= 0 && dateRange.compareTo(date, endDate) <= 0)
                ? true
                : false;
        boolean isClosed = (status.equals(closed))
                ? true
                : false;
        if (withinRange && isClosed) {
            archiveJobs.add(job);
            archiveJobCount++;
        }
    }
    return archiveJobCount;
}
----

New classes has been added to the storage component to allow Carvicim to archive closed job entries within the specified date range.

.`ArchiveCommand` Storage Component Diagram
image::ArchiveStorageComponentDiagram.png[width="800"]

As seen from Figure 18, `XmlSerializableArchiveJob` is used to serialize the archive job entries into a xml format based on `XmlAdaptedJob`.
The access of information to the archive job xml file is control by `XmlArchiveJobStorage`.
The `StorageManager` manages both the storage of Carvicim and archive data.

`StorageManager` code snippet that handles ArchiveEvent to archive the job entries:
[source,java]
----
public void handleArchiveEvent(ArchiveEvent event) {
    logger.info(LogsCenter.getEventHandlingLogMessage(event, "Archiving data, saving to file"));
    try {
        saveArchiveJob(event.data);
        saveCarvicim(event.data);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        raise(new DataSavingExceptionEvent(e));
    }
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the archive operation works:

.`ArchiveCommand` sequence diagram
image::ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `ArchiveCommand` executes +
* **Current choice:** Archive job entries within a selected date range.
** Pros: We get to select the range of job entries that we will like to archive.
** Cons: Harder to implement.
* _Alternative:_ Archives all job entries.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: We cannot select the range of job entries that we will like to archive.

===== Aspect: How `ArchiveCommand` saves data +
* **Current choice:** Creates a new archive file.
** Pros: We get to archive multiple files with different selected date range.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* _Alternative:_ Overwrites the existing archive file.
** Pros: Will use less memory.
** Cons: We cannot archive multiple files.
// end::archive[]

// tag::analyse[]
=== Analyse feature
==== Current Implementation

The `AnalyseCommand` is facilitated by a `HashMap`, which is responsible for keeping track of
the number of jobs assigned to each employee.

The `HashMap` is initialized this way:
[source,java]
----
private HashMap<Name, Integer> analyse = new HashMap<Name, Integer>();

public void initEmployeeJobCount(UniqueEmployeeList employeeList) {
    Iterator<Employee> iteratorEmployee = employeeList.iterator();
    while (iteratorEmployee.hasNext()) {
        Employee employee = iteratorEmployee.next();
        analyse.put(employee.getName(), 0);
    }
}
----

The `HashMap` is updated this way:
[source,java]
----
public void updateEmployeeJobCount(Job job) {
    Iterator<Employee> iteratorEmployee = job.getAssignedEmployees().iterator();
    while (iteratorEmployee.hasNext()) {
        Employee employee = iteratorEmployee.next();
        int jobCount = analyse.get(employee.getName());
        analyse.put(employee.getName(), jobCount + 1);
    }
}
----

`JobList` code snippet that formats the analyse result:
[source,java]
----
public String getAnalyseResult() {
    final StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
    builder.append("Number of Jobs: ")
            .append(jobCount)
            .append(" Number of Ongoing: ")
            .append(ongoingCount)
            .append(" Number of Closed: ")
            .append(closedCount)
            .append("\n");
    Set set = analyse.entrySet();
    builder.append(set);
    return builder.toString();
}
----

The following sequence diagram shows how the analyse operation works:

.`AnalyseCommand` sequence diagram
image::AnalyseSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `AnalyseCommand` executes +
* **Current choice:** Analyses job entries within the current month.
** Pros: We get to decide who should be assigned more jobs based on the analyse result.
** Cons: Harder to implement.
* _Alternative:_ Analyses all job entries.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: The analyse result would be less helpful for job assignment.
// end::analyse[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

.Inheritance diagram for commands
image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram above, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The steps below show the changes to the state of the stack for the `undo` command:

1. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

2. The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th employee in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command), as shown in the figure below.

.Step 1: `delete 5` command pushed onto the `undoStack`
image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

3. As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, as shown in the figure below, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new employee.

.Step 2: execute `add n/David ...`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

====
[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.
====


4. The user now decides that adding the employee was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

As shown in the diagram below, we will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

.Step 3: `undo` action
image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

====
[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.
====

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.`undo` sequence diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

The `redo` does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

====
[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.
====

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

.`clear` pushed into `undoStack`
image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
[none]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

.`list` not added into `undoStack`

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

.Stack activity diagram summary
image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Current choice:** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* _Alternative:_ Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Current choice:** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* _Alternative:_ Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the employee being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Current choice:** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* _Alternative:_ Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Current choice:** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* _Alternative:_ Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.

=== Login to Gmail

==== Current Implementation

This feature is implemented using https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/[Gmail API].

When the user enters the `login` command, a new GmailAuthenticator object will be created which builds an authorized Gmail client service, as seen in the diagram below.

.Login sequence diagram
image::LoginCommand_SeqDiagram.PNG[width="550"]

In the `authorize` method, a `GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow` object is created to build the authorization code flow and trigger user authorization request. It then manages and persists user `Credential` by saving it in the file path `./src/main/resources/.credentials/carvicim-gmail`. For more details, look at the the code snippet below.

The `authorize` method:
[source,java]
----
public static Credential authorize() throws IOException {
    InputStream in = GmailAuthenticator.class.getResourceAsStream("/client_secret.json");
    GoogleClientSecrets clientSecrets = GoogleClientSecrets.load(JSON_FACTORY, new InputStreamReader(in));

    GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow flow =
            new GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow.Builder(
                    httpTransport, JSON_FACTORY, clientSecrets, Arrays.asList(scope))
                    .setDataStoreFactory(dataStoreFactory)
                    .setAccessType("offline")
                    .build();
    Credential credential = new AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp(
            flow, new LocalServerReceiver()).authorize("user");
    System.out.println("Credentials saved to " + DATA_STORE_DIR.getAbsolutePath());
    return credential;
}
----
// end::logintogmail[]

// tag::sendemails[]
=== Send Emails to Employees about Job

This feature is implemented using https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/[Gmail API].

A general overview of how this feature is implemented is shown in the sequence diagram below.

.Email sequence diagram
image::EmailCommand_SeqDiagram.PNG[width="550"]

To explain the sequence of events in greater detail, when the user enters the `email j/JOB_NUMBER` command, a `UniqueEmployeeList` of `JOB_NUMBER` job is obtained from the `Job` object. Using a `for` loop, an email is sent to each employee in the `UniqueEmployeeList`.

To craft an email, an empty `Properties` list is created, which is used to create an email `Session`. A `MimeMessage`, a class in the `javax.mail.internet` package is created using that `Session`. The body of the `MimeMessage` contains details extracted from the particular `Job`, and is then encoded using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64[base64url] and repackaged into a `Message` by setting the value of the `raw` property of the `Message` to the encoded `MimeMessage`. How the repacking is done is shown in the code snippet below:
[source,java]
----
public static Message createMessageWithEmail(MimeMessage emailContent) throws MessagingException, IOException {
    ByteArrayOutputStream buffer = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    emailContent.writeTo(buffer);
    byte[] bytes = buffer.toByteArray();
    String encodedEmail = Base64.encodeBase64URLSafeString(bytes);
    Message message = new Message();
    message.setRaw(encodedEmail);
    return message;
}
----
Finally, this `Message` is sent by making a call to `messages.send`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Email content

* **Current choice:** Email content contains job information extracted from the particular Job object only
** Pros: Easier to implement, and the email will be sent out very quickly, immediately after typing one line of command, making it more convenient for the user
** Cons: User has no ability to change or add to the contents of the email if the user wishes to.
* _Alternative:_ User gets to edit or add to the email content
** Pros: Provides flexibility as the user is allowed to change and add details to the email content.
** Cons: Need to direct user to an editor, thus more difficult to implement. User would also have to go through more steps than necessary if the user does not wish to change or add details to the email content

===== Aspect: Authorization information

* **Current choice:** Stored in file system so subsequent executions will not prompt for authorization
** Pros: More convenient for the user as the user only needs to key in his or her authorization information once
** Cons: Unsafe if the computer used is a shared one as another person can send out emails from the logged in user's account.
* _Alternative:_ Prompt for authorization for every subsequent executions
** Pros: Safer as another person cannot simply send out emails from the logged in user's account, even on a shared computer.
** Cons: Inconvenient for user as user needs to always key in authorization information before sending emails for each job.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation


We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

====
[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.
====

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.

****
*Optional*

Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.
****

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

====
[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.
====

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

====
[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.
====

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

[[Testing-TypesOfTests]]
=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.carvicim.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.carvicim.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.carvicim.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.carvicim.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing.

Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +

a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

====
[NOTE]
If you are new to working on Java projects, here are some steps to get started:

. Start by adding small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to your project one component at a time. Here are some suggestions: <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.
** It is important to program incrementally, as to prepare yourself for the next step.
. Proceed to add your feature, touching multiple components. This is to familiarize yourself with the process of implementing an end-to-end feature across all components. You can read more under <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>>.
====

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

You can familiarize yourself with existing components through the proposed exercises below, 1 for each component (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work). The Car Servicing Manager is divided into 4 main components:

1. <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Logic,*`Logic`*>>
2. <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Model,*`Model`*>>
3. <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-UI,*`UI`*>>
4. <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Storage,*`Storage`*>>

For each section, the exercises are structured in the following sequence:

Proposed solution

**What’s important is that you should start practicing early!**

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Logic]]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During <<dog-fooding, dog-fooding>>, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement <<alias, aliases>> for the command words. Your job is to implement such <<alias, aliases>>.

====
[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.
====

. Begin by adding a shorthand equivalent <<alias, alias>> for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all employees in the list.

+
====
[NOTE]
=====
*Hints*

** Just like how we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for <<alias, aliases>> as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
=====
====

+
====
[TIP]
=====
*Proposed Solution*

** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and <<alias, alias>> can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new <<Testing-TypesOfTests, tests>> for each of the <<alias, aliases>> that you have added.
** Update the <<UserGuide#, User Guide>> to document the new <<alias, aliases>>.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
=====

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Model]]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model <<api, API>> does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an <<api, API>> method, so that your teammate can use your <<api, API>> to implement his command.

====
[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.
====

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.

+
====
[NOTE]
=====
*Hints*

** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] <<api, API>> need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use <<slap, SLAP>> to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing <<api, API>> methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a employee, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
=====
====

+
====
[TIP]
=====
*Proposed Solution*

** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each employee, and remove the `tag` from each employee.
** Add a new <<api, API>> method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new <<Testing-TypesOfTests, tests>> for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
*** The current codebase has a flaw in tags management. Tags no longer in use by anyone may still exist on the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. This may cause some tests to fail. See issue  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/753[`#753`] for more information about this flaw.
*** The solution PR has a temporary fix for the flaw mentioned above in its first commit.
=====
====

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-UI]]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a <<beta-testing, beta testing>> session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last employee in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

====
[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.
====

. Use different colors for different tags inside employee cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.

** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the `*hash code*` of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the `*hash code*` algorithm changes.

** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of employees whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of employees status bar.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent-Storage]]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup <<api, API>> for the address book storage.

====
[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.
====
. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

+
====
[NOTE]
=====
*Hint*

** Add the <<api, API>> method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a employee specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first employee to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first employee.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

. Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.
+
* Main:

1. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/UndoableCommand.java[`UndoableCommand`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
2. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

* Tests:

1. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `executeUndoableCommand()` throws an Exception.
2. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

. Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`
+
* Main:

1. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
2. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
3. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

* Tests:

1. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
2. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
3. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

. Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each employee later.
+
* Main:

1. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
2. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

* Tests:

1. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

. Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.
+
* Main:

1. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
2. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

* Tests:

1. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

. Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`].
+
* Main:

1. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`].
2. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the employee will be created without a remark).
3. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `carvicim.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

. Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.
+
* Main:

1. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.

* Tests:

1. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.

. Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/employee/Person.java[`Person`].
+
* Tests:

1. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the employee that it is currently building.
2. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

. Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.
+
* Main:

1. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

* Tests:

1. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

. Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.
+
* Main:

1. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a employee.

* Tests:

1. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
