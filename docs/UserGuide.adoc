Format: `login`

You will be redirected to the Gmail login page on your default internet browser, where you can then proceed to login.

[NOTE]
====
When you are redirected to the Gmail login page, CarviciM may (although unlikely to happen) appear as if it is not responding. If so, don't panic! Once you have successfully logged in to Gmail, CarviciM will be up and running again, from exactly where you left off.
====

When prompted to give your permission to allow CarviciM to access your Gmail account, click on `ALLOW`.

[WARNING]
====
Please do NOT click on `CANCEL`. Be assured that CarviciM will only use your account to send out emails to your employees.
====

For your convenience, your authorization information will be stored on your computer's file system, even after closing and reopening CarviciM. You will, therefore, only need to `login` once.
// end::login[]

// tag::sendemails[]
=== Email assigned employees belonging to a job : `email`

[NOTE]
====
* Before using this command, ensure that you are connected to the internet.
* You will need to `login` first before you can send out emails. If you have yet to `login`, the `email` command will first redirect you to the Gmail login page on your default internet browser before sending the emails. Please see Section 5.18 above on how to `login`.
====

To send auto-generated emails containing the job details from your Gmail account to all assigned employees of the job, use this command as follows: +

// end::sendemails[]

// tag::importexport[]
=== Importing jobs from an excel file `importAll`, `import`, `accept`, `reject`, `acceptAll`, `rejectAll`, `switch`
==== Importing and accepting all job entries in an excel file: `importAll`

To import all jobs into CarviciM directly, use this command as follows:
Format: `importAll FILEPATH`

Similar to <<import-command, `import`>> command, `importAll` also loads an excel file,
additionally it accepts all job entries. `importAll` is equivalent to an
<<import-command, `import`>> and <<acceptAll-command, `acceptAll`>>.

Example:

`importAll excel-file.xlsx` +
Imports example excel file excel-file.xlsx shown in <<import-command, `import`>>, accepts all job entries and saves the reviewed job entries as an external excel file.
You should see:

image::importAll-example.png[width="1200"]

==== Importing job entries discretely `import`, `accept`, `reject`, `acceptAll`, `rejectAll`, `switch`
To discretely import job entries, here are the steps you should follow:

. <<import-command, import>> a file
. <<accept-reject, `accept` and `reject`>> job entries.

[[import-command]]
===== Importing a new excel file: `import`

To start import a file, use this command as follows: +
Format: `import FILE_PATH`

[TIP]
====
If your imported file does not reflect correctly, there is an old save file from the <<save-command, autosave feature>>. To rectify the
problem:

1. Close CarviciM.
2. Look for a file in the same folder with the same filename, with `-comments.xlsx` or
`-comments.xls` behind.
3. Delete the file.
4. Start CarviciM and try again.
====

[NOTE]
====
* Filepath: A text representation of the location of the file used by the computer.
* CarviciM tries to read the file by rows:
** The first row specifies the type of detail in the column. This can be seen in the table below:
====

[WARNING]
====
* The excel file must not be password-protected
* It is preferable to only import files within this application's folder, as other programs
outside the folder might affect CarviciM's performance
====

Here is an example of an excel sheet that can be imported:

[width="59%",cols="8%,8%,8%,8%,8%,8%,8%,8%,8%,8%,8%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|client name |client phone |client email |vehicle number |employee name	|employee phone |employee email| status |remarks | empty column|
|John Doe |91234567 |jd@gmail.com |SXX1234X |Jim |87654321 |jim@gmail.com |Your remark |Ongoing||
|...||||||||||
|=======================================================================

[TIP]
The columns can be interchanged, with `empty column` at the last column.

Example:

`import excel-file.xlsx` +
Imports the example file excel-file.xlsx shown above. You should see:

image::import-example.png[width="1200"]


===== Switching views between unreviewed jobs and jobs in CarviciM: `switch`

You can use this command to switch between the list of unreviewed jobs and jobs in CarviciM. +
Format: `switch`

[NOTE]
You can see the current job list in the job list indicator.

[[accept-reject]]
===== Accepting and rejecting changes

You can use 4 commands when reviewing changes:

* `accept NUMBER`
* `reject NUMBER`
* `acceptAll`
* `rejectAll`

====== Accepting 1 job: `accept`

To accept a job with job index `NUMBER` in the imported list, use this command as follows:
Format: `accept NUMBER`

Example:

`accept 1` +
Accepts the job entry with job index number 1 and removes it from imported list.

[[acceptAll-command]]
====== Accepting all remaining imported jobs: `acceptAll`

To accept all remaining jobs, use this command as follows:
Format: `acceptAll`

Example:

`acceptAll` +
Accepts all remaining job entries and clears the imported list.

====== Rejecting 1 job: `reject`

To reject a job with job index `NUMBER` in the imported list, use this command as follows:
Format: `reject NUMBER`

Example:

`reject 1` +
Rejects job entry with job index number 1 and removes it from imported list. It is not added to CarviciM.

====== Rejecting all remaining imported jobs: `rejectAll`

To reject all remaining jobs in the imported list, use this command as follows:
Format: `rejectAll`

Example:

`rejectAll` +
Rejects all remaining job entries and clears the imported list.

===== Writing comments to your reviews

While accepting or rejecting changes, you can enter your comments behind the command.

[TIP]
====
You can type any sentence as a comment, as long as it is separated from the last argument with a
spacebar character.
====

Examples:

* Example 1: +
+
`accept 1` good job` +
Accepts first job and attaches "good job" as a comment to the first job.

* Example 2: +
+
`acceptAll well done` +
Accepts all remaining imported jobs and attaches "well done" as a comment to all the remaining imported jobs.

* Example 3: +
+
`reject 1 Speak to you during tomorrow's meeting.` +
Rejects first job and attaches "Speak to you during tomorrow's meeting." as a comment to the first job.

* Example 4: +
+
`rejectAll Please check the customer details.` +
Rejects all remaining imported jobs and attaches "Please check the customer details." as a comment to all the remaining imported jobs.

[[save-command]]
==== Sharing your feedback with your employees:

To send your feedback to the job list providers, look for the save file generated after importing and reviewing your jobs.
CarviciM autosaves your comments to an excel file with `-comments.xls` or `-comments.xlsx` appended,
in the same directory.

[WARNING]
When copying `-comments.xls` or `-comments.xlsx` files, try to keep the original copy in the folder. It helps to prevent
reimporting the same jobs from the a file with the same name twice.
// end::importexport[]

// tag::set[]
=== Changing a command word : `set`

To set an easy to use word in place of a default command word, use this command as follows: +
Format: `set OLD_COMMAND_WORD NEW_COMMAND_WORD`

[NOTE]
====
* The OLD_COMMAND_WORD can be either a default command word or one which user has set previously.
* The NEW_COMMAND_WORD must be 1 word, with no spacing.

* Any default words or custom words already in use are not allowed.
====

[TIP]
====
* To remove the custom word associated with a command, type the custom word as OLD_COMMAND_WORD and
COMMAND_WORD of the command as `newWord`
+
e.g.
+
`set adde a`
+
To remove `a`, type:
+
`set a adde`
====

You don't have to worry if you forgot your custom words! They will be displayed in the result display
whenever you make a mistake!

Examples:

* Example 1: +
+
`set adde a` +
Sets `adde` command word to `a` using default. +
You will see "a has been set as an alternative for adde!" in the result display.

* Example 2: +
+
`set deletee d` +
`set d delete` +
Sets `d` to `delete` using default. +
You will see "d has been replaced with delete!" in the result display.
// end::set[]

// tag::theme[]
=== Setting a theme : `theme`

+
`undo` (reverses the `closej j/1` command) +

+
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands.
