=== Overview

image::../images/CarviciM_logo.PNG[width="150", align="left"]

https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B1/main[CarviciM] is a fast and robust desktop application for car servicing managers
monitoring and approving large volumes of job entries. It features importing
job entries from excel files, displaying job entries as eas-to-read-cards and
the ability to send reminders to employees through email.


Built on the link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] project, which is used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
the application uses JavaFX to create a Guided User Interface (GUI) with a Command Line Interface (CLI) as the main
medium of interaction. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

This portfolio acts as a summary of my contributions to CarviciM. It showcases the software engineering skills acquired and applied throughout the project.

=== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to import job entries from an excel file
** What it does: allows the user to collate job entries from different people in the form of excel files.
Also allows discrete accepting and rejecting of job entries, with autosave and a system to feedback to
excel file providers.
** Justification: A significant improvement to CarviciM by simplifying collation of job entries
from different sources, which managers often do from admins, hence saving time and effort.
** Highlights: This enhancement handles IOException thoroughly. Job entries with empty
fields will inherit their empty fields from the previous entry. Column headers does not enforce strict order.
** Credits: Apache POI and POI-ooxml library are used to support excel file handling.
* *Minor enhancement*: added a set command that allows the user to have a customized set of keywords as an
alternative to the original.
