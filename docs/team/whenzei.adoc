CarviciM is an efficient and systematic application for car servicing managers to manage their servicing jobs and employee assignment. It is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application which is optimized for users who are adpet at using the keyboard.
CarviciM is built on the link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1718S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] project (used for teaching Software Engineering principles). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

This portfolio summarizes my contributions for the development of CarviciM. It showcases the software engineering knowledge that i have learned and applied throughout the project.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to manage jobs*
** What it does: allows the user to add new job entries with employees assignment for each job, close an ongoing job entry in the application, and add remark to ongoing jobs.
** Justification: Car servicing managers need to manage huge numbers of job entries, and keep track of the employees that are assigned to them. These set of features give them a systematic and convenient way to manage the servicing jobs.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires the morphing of the _AddressBook - Level 4_ project and require substantial changes to the codebase. As the added features interact with the 'management of contacts' feature from the addressbook application, changes were to be made to the existing commands so that the newly added commands would work properly. Most changes were made in the Model component.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the theme setting feature which users can select from the list of themes.
** Justification: The default application only supports one theme and users would prefer to have more control over how the application looks. They may prefer to use different themes under certain circumstances (e.g. A brighter look would be prefered when working in a different environment, as it is more pleasing to the eyes.)
* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/functional/whenzei.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B1/main/blob/master/collated/test/whenzei.md[Test Code]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on Github.
*** Managed milestones `v1.1` - `v1.3` (3 milestones) on Github.
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Added JobDisplayPanel to support the displaying of job details (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B1/main/pull/94[#94], https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B1/main/pull/152[#152])
** Documentation:
*** Improved on the user-friendliness of the User Guide by adding screenshots and restructuring the sections to have a better flow. (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W09-B1/main/pull/179[#179])
